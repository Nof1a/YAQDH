# Yaqdh Project

### Overview:
Yaqdh is an innovative project that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance security inspection processes at airports. The project aims to assist security teams in accurately and swiftly detecting unauthorized items by analyzing images captured by X-ray machines. Yaqdh utilizes advanced machine learning models to automatically identify suspicious objects, reducing the likelihood of human error and increasing the overall security level at airports.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Detection**: Efficiently identifies suspicious items in X-ray images with high accuracy.
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves system accuracy over time through regular updates based on new data.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrates with existing airport security systems.
- **Bribery Prevention**: Enhances the integrity of inspection processes by minimizing human intervention in decision-making.

### Technologies Used:
- **Deep Learning**: To create robust models capable of processing and analyzing images.
- **YOLOv9**: For real-time object detection with high speed and precision.
- **Python and TensorFlow**: For model development, implementation, and data analysis.

### Objectives:
- Enhance the efficiency and security of inspection processes at airports.
- Provide a reliable system that improves inspection outcomes and reduces errors.
- Support national security efforts by preventing the smuggling of illegal materials across borders.
